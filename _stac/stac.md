1. [1. Prove $f(y) - f(x) \leq f(|y - x|)$ if $|y - x| \leq \frac{1}{2}$ given $f(x) = -x \log_2 x$: Analyzed the behavior of the inequality and proved a bound with detailed steps and reasoning.
](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3909381/filippovs-inductive-proof-for-jordan-canonical-form/3911296#3911296): Analyzed the behavior of the inequality and proved a bound with detailed steps and reasoning.

2. [Understanding Filippovâ€™s Inductive Proof for Jordan Canonical Form](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/...): Provided a detailed explanation and visual aid for the proof after extended discussions.

3. [Understanding the Expression $\text{tr}(\rho(X \otimes I)) = \sum_{a,b,a',b'} \rho_{ab,a'b'} X_{a,a'} \delta_{b,b'}$](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/...): Initiated and contributed to a detailed discussion on the trace properties of tensor products.

4. [The median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations (the $\ell_1$ norm)](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/...): Provided a detailed explanation of a standard proof with an original example.
