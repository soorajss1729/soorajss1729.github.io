## Linear Algebra

Linear algebra has been a crucial part of my learning journey, especially as I ventured into quantum computing. I started with Gilbert Strang's Linear Algebra, which gave me a strong foundation, but often found myself diving much deeper into concepts, beyond what the book covered. Along the way, [https://math.stackexchange.com/users/223599/sooraj-soman](Mathematics Stack Exchange) became an invaluable resource for clarifying doubts, solving challenging problems, and learning through community discussions.
