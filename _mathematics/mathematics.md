## Linear Algebra
<a name="linear-algebra"></a>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Linear algebra has been a crucial part of my learning journey, especially as I ventured into quantum computing. I started with Gilbert Strang's Linear Algebra, which gave me a strong foundation, but often found myself diving much deeper into concepts, beyond what the book covered. Along the way, [Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/users/223599/sooraj-soman) became an invaluable resource for clarifying doubts, solving challenging problems, and learning through community discussions.

These notes are an attempt to organize and share what I’ve learned over the years. They reflect not only the material from Strang's book but also the extended explorations and connections I’ve drawn while tackling questions and problems
